Broad spectrum CBD oil contains a variety of active compounds such as cannabinoids and terpenes, which we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 2. In each other's presence, these compounds work even better.</p>
<p>Let's start by explaining what CBD oil is. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a cannabinoid, a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants.

<p>Today the cost for high-quality CBD products starts from 50-75₤ for 300 mg. Hemp derived CBD products with a THC content lower than 0.3% are legal on the federal level but not legal under some state laws.
