<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. CBD has been shown, through small studies, to aid in reducing social anxiety disorder. Since July, all hemp-derived CBD products sold in stores in Indiana must include a QR code on their label that lets consumers download a product's COA to their phone. These effects make cannabidiol able to diminish the burning, prickling and tingling sensations often associated with neuropathic or nerve related pain as well as pain related to inflammation. In CBD sublingual oil, the hemp oil is combined with MCT (medium-chain triglyceride) oil that's derived from coconuts.</p>
<p>That is an important finding for people who struggle with the negative emotional effects of using marijuana. According to the experts quoted in this HuffPost article , CBD's apparent ability to aid sleep correlates with its ability to decrease anxiety and calm people down.

<p>There are no cannabinoids—CBD or THC—in hemp oil. Studies have shown cannabis (mostly THC and far less CBD) is effective for reducing pain, including musculoskeletal pain from exercise, as well as stiff joints. Cannabis can also be bred to have low THC levels and high CBD levels, but it's possible that the THC will get concentrated and included in your final products. Now, many people conflate THC and CBD.

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>
<p>For example, epilepsy studies found that "there were very clearly increases in the blood levels of some other anti-epileptic drugs when people were on CBD," Welty said. The review shows that CBD oil has shown none of the detrimental side effects of typical anti-anxiety medications and should be studied as potential treatment for these disorders.
