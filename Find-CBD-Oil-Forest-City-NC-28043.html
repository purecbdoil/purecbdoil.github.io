<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. Vaping CBD oil supposedly helps the body absorb higher amounts of CBD at a faster rate. One of the great things about Ananda Hemp is that they have seed to product control, which means they work with plant geneticists and farmers to create first-rate hemp plants. Broad spectrum oil — An oil rich in CBD and the beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes present in hemp EXCEPT for THC. Its CBD products are sourced exclusively from non-GMO, organically grown, sustainable hemp to phytonutrient-rich hemp oils and terpenes.</p>

Our quality department has processes in place to verify the concentration and quality of our CBD products. CBD almost seems too good to be true but the science behind its benefits is overwhelming, and the body of literature supporting it literally grows every day.

<p>Seniors can benefit from CBD if you're looking for a natural, plant-based product instead of pharmaceuticals. A reputable company should be willing to offer detailed answers to any questions you may have about their products, how they are made, and the steps they take to ensure that their quality is consistent. However, due to its molecular structure, CBD saturates efficiently when infused into a carrier oil with high triglyceride content. Worse, CBD is being produced without any regulation, resulting in products that vary widely in quality, said Marcel Bonn-Miller, an adjunct assistant professor of psychology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.</p>
