In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options.

CBD sellers are popping up everywhere, some with product labels that are misleading and, at times, illegal. Some retailers hold that CBD isn't the drug version of cannabis, and isn't subject to the same drug laws as medical marijuana is. You'll read that retailers are free to ship it anywhere they want to in the United States and in 40 additional countries.</p>
<p>When customers ask what makes us different, or why they should buy from Premium Jane, our response is that they're buying a truly top-quality hemp oil that's been responsibly grown and extracted using state-of-the-art, precision equipment. The specialist will discuss with you all the other treatment options first, before considering a cannabis-based product. We need more research but CBD may be prove to be an option for managing anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain Without sufficient high-quality evidence in human studies we can't pinpoint effective doses, and because CBD is currently is mostly available as an unregulated supplement, it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting.</p>
<p>For mild discomfort and health problems, there's the 125mg CBD oil which offers about 2.08mg of CBD per serving. However, in the hemp plant, which is a different strain of the species Cannabis sativa, CBD is the main active ingredient, and THC is barely present, making its use and legality more widespread. These seeds are high in protein, healthy fats, and other minerals but low in THC or the psychoactive compound you can find in marijuana. If a vendor is marketing something as hemp oil, make sure that you dientify whether it's hemp seed oil or in fact CBD hemp oil made from aerial parts of the plant.</p>
