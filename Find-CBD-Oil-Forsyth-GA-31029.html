<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. At this point, it's important to stress out that CBD oils are different from CBD tinctures. Our 500mg Broad Spectrum THC-free Hemp Oil features numerous cannabinoids: Cannabidiol (CBD), Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDa), Cannabidivarin (CBDV), Cannabichromene (CBC), and Cannabinol (CBN).

<p>Once consumed, THC attaches itself to the body's cannabinoid receptors and activates them immediately, which is why you can get high from consuming THC products.

If you know you may be subjected to drug screening, it's recommended to avoid the use of CBD products. CBD is present in most marijuana products, often along.

Several studies have found that the use of CBD oil is helpful in reducing anxiety , meaning it could be a beneficial natural remedy for sufferers.</p>
<p>Opting for quality over quantity, the only product they sell is their full-spectrum CBD tincture. Ver√© partners with the best labs in the industry that use chromatography to identify and eliminate trace THC in our Broad Spectrum CBD Oil Tincture and our Pure CBD Oil, while preserving the profile of the non-psychoactive cannabinoids. This is important mainly if you want to avoid the head-high that comes with THC, something that is important to many people who are considering CBD. Many CBD products sold online and in retail stores come from hemp, not marijuana.</p>
<p>Ideally, authentic CBD products contain high amounts of CBD. Our 500mg Whole-Hemp Extract Oil features the complete plant profile containing the same cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids present in the original hemp plant. When flying with CBD products, caution is advised. That includes even some companies that use imported hemp, such as CV Sciences, which makes Plus CBD Oil from hemp grown in Holland. For CBD oil to be legal, CBD should be derived from hemp and contain no more than 0.3% THC. One of the most popular reasons that people try CBD oil is to reduce anxiety and depression.</p>
