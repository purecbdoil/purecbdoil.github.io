<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. Scientists have identified over 80+ cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, including CBD, CBG, CBC, and CBN. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis, and causes the sensation of getting high” that's often associated with marijuana. Our Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil contains more than CBD and includes cannabinoids—CBDa, CBDV, CBG, CBC and less than 0.3% trace of THC—in addition to terpenes and flavonoids. There are literally hundreds of CBD companies selling CBD online that will ship directly to your door — many of which don't even charge for shipping.</p>
<p>In this manner of usage, the oil is measured out according to the best dosage for the individual in question and taken just as any other liquid medication would be. The CBD oil travels through the digestive system and is processed by the liver, which then sends the various compounds through the body via the bloodstream. Finally, if you are really serious about using high-quality CBD oil, the best option is to make your own product at home. The best CBD oils, capsules or edibles (gummies, cookies, brownies etc) are an excellent way to help your body recover after a hand workout.</p>
