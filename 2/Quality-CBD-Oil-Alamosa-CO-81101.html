<p>Hemp seed oil is another effective extraction solvent and a carrier vehicle that mixes well with CBD. CBD hemp oil can be extracted from both the hemp and cannabis plant, but the former contains3 percent THC or less, and therefore bypasses the legal issues associated with cannabis production. CBD additionally affects THC function by inhibiting first-pass hepatic metabolism to the possibly more psychoactive 11-hydroxy-THC, prolonging its half-life, and reducing associated intoxication, panic, anxiety and tachycardia.</p>
