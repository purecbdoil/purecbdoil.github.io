<p>That is an important finding for people who struggle with the negative emotional effects of using marijuana. According to the experts quoted in this HuffPost article , CBD's apparent ability to aid sleep correlates with its ability to decrease anxiety and calm people down. There are companies out there that work hard to make their products more affordable without sacrificing quality. CBD oil, on the other hand, is made from the leaves, flower, stems, and bud of the Cannabis plant. As you might guess, the effects of this type of oil are different than that of a pure CBD oil.</p>
