<p>In other words, they tend to have a better day when they are on treatment with CBD-rich cannabis. CBD oil derived from hemp will not produce a high.” Hemp is a type of cannabis plant grown for industrial use, such as making paper and clothing.

So CBD oils extracted with solvents will contain a lower concentration of CBD. In AD 77, Pliny the Elder claims that the Romans used cannabis hemp to relief pain and to perform healing arts.</p>
