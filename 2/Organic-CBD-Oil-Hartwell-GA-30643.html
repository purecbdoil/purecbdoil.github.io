<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. The combined benefits of antioxidants, omegas and cannabinoids in hemp are another way to support overall exercise recovery. You can buy CBD topicals on Amazon, including such brands as CBDfx and Medterra — but these products are usually sold through resellers rather than the manufacturer itself. CBD Oil with THC - This type of oil, most often referred to as ‘cannabis oil,' is illegal in some states due to its THC content.

Because studies are pointing to cannabinoids as a promising treatment for inflammation , CBD may, in fact, be a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's.

<p>The amount of CBD present in the trichomes will depend on the particular variety of cannabis or hemp.

<p>Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common side effect for people who take relatively large doses of CBD oil, and is linked to the substance interacting with the digestive system. Although numerous factors cause it, CBD oil may help treat the problem due to its anti-inflammatory properties and the ability to reduce sebum production. Some oils contain other Cannabinoids within the oil. Cannabinoids: Biologically active chemical compounds found in cannabis plants. Cannabinoids are a class of diverse chemical compounds that are found in the cannabis plant.</p>
<p>As you shop for CBD products, it's also important to understand that CBD oil is not the same as hemp seed oil (which is sometimes labeled hemp oil). One study in Frontiers in Pharmacology, suggested cannabinoids' anti-inflammatory effect may reduce inflammation too much. THC of course is an active component in marijuana that can help with various medical conditions. Cannabidiol may also limit inflammation in the brain and nervous system, which may benefit people experiencing pain, insomnia , and certain immune-system responses.</p>
