<p>Sabaidee grows its hemp in Colorado and tests its products in-house before sending them to an independent laboratory, so you can be assured that Sabaidee's CBD is pure and potent. Studies on CBD for migraines have been extremely slow and low in volume, possibly due to the combination of the obstacle of cannabis legalisation, combined with the fact migraines aren't considered as serious as many other issues on this list.
