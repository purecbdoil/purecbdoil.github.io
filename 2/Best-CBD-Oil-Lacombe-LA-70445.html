<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. Yet another study, published in Current Pharmaceutical Design, another peer-reviewed medical journal that covers issues related to pharmacology and medicinal chemistry, found that CBD has effects similar to those of certain antipsychotic drugs and that this compound is much safer and a more effective option for people with schizophrenia. Research conducted exploring what is CBD and CBD benefits also conclude that cannabidiol produces an therapeutic effects by activating PPARs, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.</p>
<p>In a study into the effects of CBD in people with Parkinson's disease and psychosis, six participants showed significant improvement in symptoms with a dosage of 150 mg per day of CBD.
