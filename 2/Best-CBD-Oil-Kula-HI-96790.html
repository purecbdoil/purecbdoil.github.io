<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Despite the above listed potential side effects, a review of clinical data found that the side effects of CBD used for certain applications were less severe than side effects from common medications used to treat those same health conditions.

<p>Hemp seed oil is another effective extraction solvent and a carrier vehicle that mixes well with CBD. CBD hemp oil can be extracted from both the hemp and cannabis plant, but the former contains3 percent THC or less, and therefore bypasses the legal issues associated with cannabis production. CBD additionally affects THC function by inhibiting first-pass hepatic metabolism to the possibly more psychoactive 11-hydroxy-THC, prolonging its half-life, and reducing associated intoxication, panic, anxiety and tachycardia.</p>
