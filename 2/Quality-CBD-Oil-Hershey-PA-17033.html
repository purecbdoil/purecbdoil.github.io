<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. In short, to determine whether a CBD oil or any other CBD product is legal or illegal depends on a multitude of factors. In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
<p>For most children, the health benefits of outweigh the side effects. Some people turn to hemp Oil because of the flavor, and that makes a difference. While hemp oil does contain trace amounts of THC, the levels are about 100 times lower than the federal limit of 0.3%. Most drug screens are targeting delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and don't detect constituents of other hemp-based cannabidiols. For the highest concentration of CBD, products like our flagship brand Real Scientific Hemp Oil (RSHO) pure CBD hemp oil gives you up to 190 mg of CBD per serving.</p>

Broad spectrum CBD oil contains a variety of active compounds such as cannabinoids and terpenes, which we will discuss in greater detail in Chapter 2. In each other's presence, these compounds work even better.</p>

<p>CBD oil products mimic the naturally oily plant material they're extracted from. Research shows that CBD injections reduce the pain of surgical incision in rats and that it also reduces inflammation and nerve pain. In another 2014 study , 22 people with Parkinson's Disease who received CBD-rich cannabis saw significant improvement in pain, tremors, sleep, and mobility.

Vaping allows you to feel the benefits of CBD the fastest, but scientists warn that we still don't know what the long term effects of vapes are.

To make hemp oil products for consumer use, the flowers (or buds) are harvested from the fibrous industrial hemp plants and the plant's oil is extracted from the flowers.</p>
<p>This is not legal advice and wasn't reviewed by any lawyers, so consult a licensed attorney in your own jurisdiction to find out whether CBD is legal or not. However, studies show that eating hemp foods and oils may cause a positive result in urine or blood screenings.
