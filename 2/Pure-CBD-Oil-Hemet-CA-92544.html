The genetically-selected plants have been bred across dozens of generations to produce only the highest CBD varieties of industrial hemp, thus ensuring that our end products - whether they be full-spectrum oils, CBD capsules, topical lotions, or edible CBD gummies - are of the utmost quality. The time it takes for CBD oil to take effect depends on how you take it. Oils take longer to work than inhaled CBD and topicals.</p>

In patients who use cannabis along with other pharmaceutical drugs , studies have found that there were few reported negative side effects which could be linked to interactions with other medications. A full-spectrum CBD product will contain trace amounts of all the cannabinoids that naturally occur in the hemp plant, including up to03% THC.
