<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. Since CBD oils contain extremely low amounts of THC, it's unlikely that CBD oil would cause you to fail a drug test. Marijuana-based CBD oil is illegal to use recreationally, but can be used by medical patients with certain conditions; no THC amount restrictions. In some states, CBD falls under the same laws as marijuana as it could contain THC — one of the well-known psychoactive cannabis compounds. Despite ongoing debate, the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoid-related products represents the revival of a plant with historical significance into modern day healthcare.</p>

According to the experts quoted in this HuffPost article , CBD's apparent ability to aid sleep correlates with its ability to decrease anxiety and calm people down. There are companies out there that work hard to make their products more affordable without sacrificing quality. CBD oil, on the other hand, is made from the leaves, flower, stems, and bud of the Cannabis plant. As you might guess, the effects of this type of oil are different than that of a pure CBD oil.</p>

Most doctors don't specialize medicinal cannabis and CBD oil. CBD products do not typically cause the high” that is a result of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) found in cannabis and is often associated with any use of marijuana.
