<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. While CBD oil is made from the leaves or buds of a cannabis plant, hempseed oil is made by pressing oil from hempseed,” says Kyle, who likened it to how olive oil is made by pressing whole olives. Both hemp and marijuana have dozens of other beneficial phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol. Because the FDA doesn't regulate CBD, it is possible to buy a product that is more or less potent than advertised, or even contains small amounts of THC. Hemp seeds make an effective way to grow hemp crops that will eventually produce CBD, but you have to really know how to plant the seeds.</p>

Due to CBD's non-psychoactive effects, it has gained significant interest in the medical community and has shown a high potential for therapeutic use, including as an antiepileptic (treat epilepsy), anxiolytic (treat anxiety ), antipsychotic (treat psychosis and mental health -related problems) and anti-inflammatory (treat pain and arthritis).</p>

Scientists refer to a phenomenon called the entourage effect.” This principle suggests that cannabinoids like CBD work best in combination with other cannabinoids (like THC, CBN, and CBG). The compound is also nonpsychoactive (meaning it does not produce the ‘high' associated with cannabis use), making it a safe and effective option for patients who may be concerned about the mind altering effects of other cannabinoids such as THC.</p>
<p>Because CBD oil comes from a plant, it is all-natural, making CBD a go-to in the world of natural remedies. Many of these products are advertised as hemp oil supplements.” However, upon further investigation, you'll notice none of them mention anything about CBD. Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine. While there's a lot of tongue-wagging around cannabis-related products, there is a burgeoning awareness about the potential medical benefits of CBD oil.</p>
