<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. In the US, CBD must also be derived exclusively from hemp, but the THC limit is 0.3% THC. Anxiety: A much-cited 2011 study published in Neuropsychopharmacology found that pretreatment with CBD significantly reduced anxiety before a public speaking engagement. Love CBD oil was developed because most of the CBD oils being sold on the market were being made from industrial hemp waste. Most CBD oils are just that … the beneficial CBD without the THC. A prescription-only nasal spray product (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) containing both 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol has been shown to be effective for improving pain, muscle-tightness, and urination frequency in people with MS. This product is used in over 25 countries outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Epidiolex , a CBD oral solution, was approved by the FDA in 2018 to treat people with one of two rare forms of epilepsy — Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome Scientists believe CBD oil helps suppress seizures by slowing down messages being sent to the brain, changing calcium levels in brain cells and decreasing inflammation in the brain. CBD oil is even becoming popular among pet owners who wish to help their pets live healthier lives. This is a common phenomenon among people who use CBD or any other cannabinoids - in both cases of consuming or smoking.</p>
