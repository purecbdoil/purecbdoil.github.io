<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. The combination of cannabinoids, as opposed to just CBD, can affect multiple targets within the body and enhance the overall effect. Every single day, people hear about CBD oil and how it keeps our bodies running at their best for the first time. CBD can impact the interaction between endocannabinoids and these receptors, thereby potentially providing some pain relief through this process. For example, in one 2010 study , researchers found that using CBD to treat diabetic mice with cardiovascular disease help reduce oxidative stress (which is linked to inflammation) and prevent heart failure.</p>

<p>Some companies use solvents, like with ethanol extraction, when extracting CBD and that's something you have to be careful of.

In 23 states, it's legal in some form, such as for medicinal purposes.</p>
