<h3>Best Place To Buy CBD Oil in Suitland MD</h3>

Lee, author of "Smoke Signals: A Social History of Marijuana - Medical, Recreational and Scientific" and the director of Project CBD , an educational site about CBD and its benefits, to find out what exactly CBD is and how it's made. Hemp oil refers to extracts obtained from the seeds of the cannabis Sativa plant, which contain trace amounts of CBD. Four Leaf Rover hemp-derived CBD Oil contains less than 0.3% THC.

<p>In 2015 and in 2016, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) ran some tests on CBD products sold through websites. Researchers at the Department of Pharmacognosy, The School of Pharmacy, University of London, UK, basis the study conducted on mice found that CBD oil has analgesic properties and may relieve chronic pain of all kinds It can disrupt the activity of pain receptors in the body and instead cause a release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine - feel good” compounds that can ease discomfort and pain, even if the pharmaceutical painkillers have no effect.</p>
