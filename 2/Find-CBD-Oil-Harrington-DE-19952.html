<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. You can also add this oil to your smoothies and shakes so that you have the health benefits of a product such as this. While both of these contain THC and CBD, we suggest you stick to oil extracted from hemp if you want to reap maximum CBD oil health benefits. Additionally, several animal studies have demonstrated that CBD may help reduce the inflammation and cell death associated with heart disease due to its powerful antioxidant and stress-reducing properties.

Several studies have shown that CBD oil has a high potential for treating skin conditions, like eczema, by encouraging abnormal cell death.

Most trials that have been published have used either marijuana, a combination of CBD and THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), or only involved animals.

For therapeutic uses, many people prefer hemp-derived CBD products, as they do not cause intoxication.</p>
