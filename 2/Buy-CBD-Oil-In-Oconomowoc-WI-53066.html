One studied, illustrated by the infographic above, investigated the impact of CBD oil on sleep quality, anxiety, and depression among 72 adults ( R ). This study found the majority of subjects saw significant improvements in all three categories with improvements being retained up to three months after the start of CBD treatment.</p>
<p>As cannabis and hemp become more extensively researched and widely available, we are starting to realize the true therapeutic power of these plants and their derivatives. As a reminder, CBD products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. In states where medical marijuana or recreational marijuana is legal, marijuana-derived CBD may also be available.
