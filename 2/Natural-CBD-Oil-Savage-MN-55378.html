<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. CBD Hemp Oil - Often referred to as full-spectrum CBD oil” or full-spectrum hemp extract,” these oils are produced by extracting phytochemicals and phytocannabinoids from industrial hemp - a variety of cannabis that contains less than 0.3% THC by weight. However, cannabinol (CBN) did trigger a positive test, and of course, products with some THC triggered a positive test as well.

<p>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid - a chemical compound that acts throughout the body, including on certain parts of the brain, and is becoming increasingly popular in the health world.

Many CBD products display the percentage of CBD contained in the product, which will be between around 2% and 11% of the total (the rest being made up of hemp oil and other ingredients such as olive oil).
