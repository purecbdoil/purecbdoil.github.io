<p>While marijuana has been used to treat pain for centuries, CBD introduces a new way to achieve the same result. The THC + CBD combination produced a significant reduction in pain while THC alone did not ( R ). The patients in this study suffered from pain not relieved by opioids which is yet another vote of confidence in my opinion for the importance of furthering research on CBD. 2.
