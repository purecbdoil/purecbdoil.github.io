<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. However, hemp farmers rarely modify the plant. CBD oil is a liquid extract that can be used orally or however you enjoy taking it. Many CBD users choose oil because it is a quick way to experience the effects of CBD anytime and anywhere.

Our registered industrial hemp-derived Pure CBD Oil tests at a minimum of 99%+ CBD purity and is third-party lab tested and verified 100% THC-free. Furthermore, another study that included 214 people suffering from serious epilepsy showed that their seizures were reduced by 36.5% when using CBD oil.</p>
