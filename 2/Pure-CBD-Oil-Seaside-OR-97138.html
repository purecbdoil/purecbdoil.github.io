<p>This means that a doctor must apply to the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) for an approval to be able to prescribe products containing CBD. The CBD in most products is extracted from hemp, a variety of cannabis that has only traces (up to 0.3%) of THC, the active compound that gets people high.

Our vision is to pave the way for a line of cannabinoid wellness products that promote a healthy body and mind. This marketplace does not allow the sale of CBD products; that's why you will not find well-known reputable brands there.

<p>Technically speaking, the law now recognizes hemp (and by association CBD oil) as a non-controlled substance and differentiates it from marijuana. One of the most crucial steps in producing CBD oil is isolating the relevant cannabinoids and terpenes via CO₂ extraction. This being the case, there are a lot of companies taking advantage of the CBD oil demand thus are making products that don't contain enough or any CBD at all. Meanwhile, hemp seed oil (sometimes called just hemp oil) is made from only the seeds of the hemp plant and contains minuscule (if any) quantities of CBD.</p>
