<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. One important way in which CBD oil may help athletes is by reducing pain and minimizing inflammation post-workout. With a range spanning from CBD oils to CBD chocolates, all manufactured in the UK to strict specifications, customers can trust in Hempura for their CBD requirements. CBD oil derived from marijuana (Cannabis sativa plants containing more than 0.3% THC), on the other hand, is federally illegal. Pure hemp oil does not contain any cannabinoids, and therefore will not provide the same effect as CBD oil.</p>
<p>CBD hemp oil has a huge range of potential health benefits and uses, including reducing pain, soothing anxiety, fighting chronic diseases, improving mood, eliminating depression , preventing inflammatory arthritis, protecting the immune system, balancing the metabolism , aiding sleep disorders, and healing the skin , among others. Cannabinoids are naturally produced by the human body and found in certain plants such as hemp. CBD is another cannabinoid also known as Cannabidiol which constitutes up to 40% of the plant's overall contents.</p>

Even further, this product consists of only two ingredients: CBD hemp oil and hemp seed oil containing vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. CBD is mostly used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, cancer, nausea, vomiting, eating disorders, pain, arthritis, inflammation, epilepsy and seizures.</p>

<p>Companies that market CBD oil make a wide variety of claims about it. However, scientists and doctors emphasize that the research on CBD is limited, and has been slowed in the United States by federal restrictions. The studies provide proof of principle” that CBD and possibly CBD-THC combinations are valid candidates for novel AD therapies. Less potent than cannabis (from which it's derived), but more potent than hemp (also derived from weed), the specific benefits of CBD are much less well-known than the ingredients itself.</p>
<p>This is not legal advice and wasn't reviewed by any lawyers, so consult a licensed attorney in your own jurisdiction to find out whether CBD is legal or not. However, studies show that eating hemp foods and oils may cause a positive result in urine or blood screenings.
