Another plus is that all of Penguin's CBD oil comes from USDA-certified hemp farmed in Oregon, and the quality of their products is backed up with independent lab testing.</p>
<p>If the product is full-spectrum, it will have less than 0.3% THC, the federally legal limit for industrial hemp plants. Hemp-derived CBD oils are great because they can provide the healing potential of cannabis without the high.
