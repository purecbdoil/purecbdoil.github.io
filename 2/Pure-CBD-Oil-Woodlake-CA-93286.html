<p>In other words, they tend to have a better day when they are on treatment with CBD-rich cannabis. CBD oil derived from hemp will not produce a high.” Hemp is a type of cannabis plant grown for industrial use, such as making paper and clothing. For example, if the product contains 500 mg of CBD, the same concentration of cannabinoids should be mentioned in the report. So CBD oils extracted with solvents will contain a lower concentration of CBD. In AD 77, Pliny the Elder claims that the Romans used cannabis hemp to relief pain and to perform healing arts.</p>
<p>A research backed alternative to address pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, along with fungal and bacterial infection” (Russo, 2011).
