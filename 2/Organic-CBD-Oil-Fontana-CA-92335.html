<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. CBD and THC are both cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant. While the negative perception towards everything cannabis has made headway in recent years, CBD oil hasn't been normalized nationwide.

Today, CBD oil is available to most people in the United States and research into CBD's effects on the human body has ramped up substantially. CBD oil-that is to say real, quality CBD oil-is an amazing therapy that's possibly helped thousands of people.</p>
<p>These products work well for people who can't consume any THC due to their jobs. CBD is a compound that interacts with your endocannabinoid system and other vital systems in your body to help manage stress and alter pain perception. CBD research is ongoing, and while larger clinical trials are necessary to confirm, plenty of studies show promise in using CBD oil to treat a variety of health issues. It comes from the cannabis plant; however, unlike its counterpart, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the 'high' from marijuana, CBD, derived from the hemp plant, is non-intoxicating and some believe it may have potential health and wellness benefits.</p>

<p>The natural, holistic remedy has real medicinal use spanning from stopping seizures to alleviating anxiety and helping insomniacs get some much-needed rest-with little to no side effects, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

THC is known to have the potential to cause anxiety (often referred to as ‘paranoia' in the setting of cannabis). If you have food sensitivities or health concerns, be aware that they do have undisclosed ingredients in the CBD oil - the phrase natural ingredients” is included on the label for flavored CBD tinctures.</p>
<p>You'll see two main categories of CBD oils during your research: full-spectrum and isolates. This inspired the strong belief that people have a right to high-quality, fairly priced, U.S. grown, hemp-derived CBD products.

<p>Animal studies have shown that treatment with CBD significantly lowered the amount of damage to brain tissue following states of low blood flow characteristic of stroke (cerebral infarction) ( R ). It's believed this action is made possible by interaction with serotonin receptors.
