More research needs to be done, but there is some evidence CBD can protect the heart against vascular damage caused by high glucose, inflammation, or type 2 diabetes, according to a 2013 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology The European Journal of Pharmacology also published a study earlier this year that pointed toward CBD aiding heart health.</p>
