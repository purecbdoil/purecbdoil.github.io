<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. In short, to determine whether a CBD oil or any other CBD product is legal or illegal depends on a multitude of factors. In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Take note that taking CBD oil with a high potency option isn't a guarantee that you'll get the benefits right away. However, some research shows that the majority of the hemp-derived CBD products on the market - specifically what is being sold online — are not manufactured under the highest standards Some contain less CBD than advertised, some have more. According to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures , 33 states plus Washington DC, Guam, and Puerto Rico have medical marijuana and medicinal cannabis by-products programs, and 13 states have separate laws allowing low THC, high CBD” products for medicinal or recreational use.</p>

Be aware that CBD products can legally contain up to 0.3% THC so this may trigger a positive drug test. Even further, this product consists of only two ingredients: CBD hemp oil and hemp seed oil containing vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids.

<p>A broad-spectrum product will contain all of those cannabinoids except the THC - which has been removed. However, it's important to note that operating a vehicle or heavy machinery after taking CBD oil — especially higher doses — can increase one's risk of being involved in an accident. CBD oil can technically be CBD hemp oil, but hemp oil is not necessarily CBD oil — and is most often hempseed oil,” she explains. There are thousands of unique CBD extracts online — each with different formulas, total amounts of CBD, hemp sources, delivery methods, bottle sizes, flavors, scents… the list continues.</p>
<p>Due to controversies surrounding the cannabis plant, industrial-grade CBD is extracted from hemp (another plant that falls under the Cannabis Sativa species), as it has less than 0.3% THC.
