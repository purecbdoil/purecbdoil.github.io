<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. Hemp oil extract in the United States refers to the oil extracted from the stalk of the hemp plant. In the United States, CBD oil is legal in some states, but not all.

Bottom line: CBD oil has been found through several studies to help reduce depression and anxiety disorders in both animals and humans.
