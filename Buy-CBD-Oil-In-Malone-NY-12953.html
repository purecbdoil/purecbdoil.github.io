<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. CBD is non-intoxicating, it comes with a plethora of potential therapeutic benefits, and above all, it has no side effects of traditional painkillers. Seniors are increasingly looking towards CBD for treating aches and pains, but it can be challenging to find safe products while the market isn't regulated. So our hemp oil products won't get you high. Each batch is tested in a third-party lab, and results can be found directly on the website, which is critical in ensuring the quality of your products. We use a broad-spectrum extract for all of our CBD oils.</p>
<p>By augmenting the body's own cannabinoids, CBD and the other trace cannabinoids found in hemp oil are able to stimulate the endocannabinoid system to encourage balance and optimal functioning. However, when used in moderate amounts, most people do not experience these side effects, and none of them are known for being fatal or particularly dangerous. Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>
