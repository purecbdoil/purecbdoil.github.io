<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. Similar studies reported very comparable findings—CBD oil benefits and side effects exist, with the latter being in a far lesser degree in both intensity and frequency when compared to the former. There is a slight running theme here in how CBD oil has shown to help so many mental illnesses - from anxiety and pain to depression and schizophrenia. CBD oil is genuinely good for healing and improving numerous health conditions - not because it's some sort of miracle” but because of its biochemical ingredients and their action on the system of receptors inside our bodies.</p>

Because it's derived from the cannabis plant, many people still associate it with drugs and drug addiction, even though research has shown that CBD is neither psychoactive nor harmful. Currently, the cultivation, production, and use of CBD oil are primarily concentrated in Canada, the US and several countries in Europe.</p>
<p>Experts hope CBD may be used alone to treat anxiety disorders or to enhance the benefits of other traditional therapies and medications. Be aware that CBD products can legally contain up to 0.3% THC so this may trigger a positive drug test. Even further, this product consists of only two ingredients: CBD hemp oil and hemp seed oil containing vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. CBD is mostly used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, cancer, nausea, vomiting, eating disorders, pain, arthritis, inflammation, epilepsy and seizures.</p>

<p>Companies that market CBD oil make a wide variety of claims about it. However, scientists and doctors emphasize that the research on CBD is limited, and has been slowed in the United States by federal restrictions. The studies provide proof of principle” that CBD and possibly CBD-THC combinations are valid candidates for novel AD therapies. Less potent than cannabis (from which it's derived), but more potent than hemp (also derived from weed), the specific benefits of CBD are much less well-known than the ingredients itself.</p>
<p>It's important to know that although THC and CBD are the most studied components of cannabis, there are many more chemical compounds found within the plant, such as the phytocannabinoids cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), as well as terpenes and flavonoids. CBD oil is an isolated extraction of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol. THC is the psychoactive component of cannabis that causes a euphoric high, but CBD oils contain very low concentrations of THC.</p>
