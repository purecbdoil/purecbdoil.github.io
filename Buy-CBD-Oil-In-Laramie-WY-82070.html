<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. They offer high-potency products like Super Good Vibes, which has over 33 mg of CBD in each dropper-full. People refer to cannabis plants as either hemp or marijuana, depending on how much THC they contain.

In recent studies shown in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, there is an undeniable connection between the reduction of pain and inflammation and CBD. Although there are several products available in the market that can reduce the aging effects, most of them are not effective like CBD oil products.

<p>Hemp oil or hemp seed oil = hemp or cannabis seeds. Today, the cannabinoids found in hemp have been featured in scientific studies, are making headlines on newsstands ( USA Today ), and breaking news on the air ( CBS News , CNN ) for their promising health benefits.

<p>For a product to legally be considered hemp oil, there must be less than 0.3% THC in the CBD products. Since CBD oil includes the full spectrum of cannabinoids, it can produce what experts call an entourage effect ,” where multiple compounds work together to create more intense and possibly more beneficial effects than each compound could have individually. CBD products are not well regulated, so there can be inconsistencies in how much CBD is in a product. CBD, though, does not contain the chemical in marijuana that makes people high.</p>
