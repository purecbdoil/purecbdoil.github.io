Full-spectrum CBD oils will include the full spectrum of cannabinoids available in cannabis plants. Namely, the Farm Bill form 2018 legalized the production of hemp as long as it has a THC concentration below 0.3%. Since CBD oil is most often extracted from hemp itself, it doesn't even have that high of a THC composition anyway.</p>
