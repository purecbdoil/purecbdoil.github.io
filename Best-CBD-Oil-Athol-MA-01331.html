<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. More research is needed to determine the exact role that terpenes play in the overall effects of CBD oil, but it seems clear that terpenes work in concert with cannabinoids to produce a richer effect than CBD alone. First, testing by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has found evidence of ‘potential adverse health effects' from CBD (more on that later) and the FSA has concerns over CBD products being sold that contain unlisted and possibly even hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of psychoactive THC.</p>
<p>Medical grade cannabis oils are highly regulated meaning that they must conform to strict standards such as clearly stating all ingredients and active ingredient measures on the product packaging. Be sure to check the label: all CBD oils should have data on CBD and THC content. Forbes discussed that it's now becoming a trend to make your own CBD products as a means of having more control of the quality and for cost-savings. I have read that CBD hemp oil can be useful for my condition of neurological and inflammation issues.</p>

Their products are extracted with the use of sustainable technologies, not to mention that Endoca sources their CBD from their own hemp plants cultivated in the finest regions of Scandinavia.

The matter was investigated later by the CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention), and it was revealed that the CBD oil consumed by the affected people was fake.</p>
<p>Because CBD oil comes from a plant, it is all-natural, making CBD a go-to in the world of natural remedies. Many of these products are advertised as hemp oil supplements.” However, upon further investigation, you'll notice none of them mention anything about CBD. Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine. While there's a lot of tongue-wagging around cannabis-related products, there is a burgeoning awareness about the potential medical benefits of CBD oil.</p>
