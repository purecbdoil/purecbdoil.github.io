But CBD in its isolate and low-THC forms is not likely to cause anxiety.</p>
<p>Heating the plant matter in an oven will decarboxylate the cannabinoids, turning THCA into THC and CBDA into CBD. In one study, CBD showed promise for inducing deeper REM sleep , while another study of Parkinson's disease patients found that taking CBD oil reduced symptoms of insomnia And with CBD's potential to relieve anxiety and pain, falling asleep becomes more likely, as these experiences can interfere with getting proper rest.
