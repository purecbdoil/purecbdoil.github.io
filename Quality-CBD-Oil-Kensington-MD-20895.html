<p>This suggests there could be a human application for pain and inflammation treatment There are some possibilities suggested here,” says Dr. Ring. Collectively, our findings suggest that, due to the combined lipostatic, antiproliferative, and antiinflammatory effects, CBD has potential as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Another study showed that chronic CBD administration also had anxiety-producing effects in rats, as opposed to the findings of most studies that had examined acute administration.</p>
