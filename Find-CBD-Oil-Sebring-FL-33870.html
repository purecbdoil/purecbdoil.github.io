<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil in dietary supplements comes from the industrial hemp plant, which is in the same family as marijuana. As mentioned, state laws surrounding cannabis products vary. The main reason there are few trials to back up the perceived health benefits of CBD is that previous laws lumped marijuana and hemp together in the same basket. Each of these uses our high quality hemp extract, with 0% THC. Some manufacturers are advertising CBD products with unproven medical claims, and the quality and safety of these products can vary.</p>
<p>We also supply a range of natural hemp skin care products for daily use plus a range of creams and balms to treat various conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, cuts, bites and burns.

As voters in more and more states choose to legalize marijuana for medicinal and increasingly for recreational use, related products like CBD oil are trending.</p>
