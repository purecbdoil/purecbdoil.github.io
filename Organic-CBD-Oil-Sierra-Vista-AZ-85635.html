CBD research is ongoing, and while larger clinical trials are necessary to confirm, plenty of studies show promise in using CBD oil to treat a variety of health issues. It comes from the cannabis plant; however, unlike its counterpart, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the 'high' from marijuana, CBD, derived from the hemp plant, is non-intoxicating and some believe it may have potential health and wellness benefits.</p>
