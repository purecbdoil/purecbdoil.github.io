<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not.

I've tried alot of different products but always seem to get Hemp Oil instead of CBD oil. CBD is also different from THC, the other main active ingredient in cannabis, in that it does not produce psychoactive effects or create a high.</p>
<p>The pressure from the CO2 breaks down the plant and produces the CBD oil. In fact, the human body possesses an endocannabinoid system which works with the natural cannabinoid receptors in the brain and immune system to reduce pain, inflammation, and other things which jeopardize your internal homeostasis. The legal status of CBD products depends on psychotropic substances content. The main difference is that marijuana-derived CBD oils often contain high quantities of THC.

CBD oil is not a product on which you should skimp on quality.</p>
<p>Companies that market CBD oil make a wide variety of claims about it. However, scientists and doctors emphasize that the research on CBD is limited, and has been slowed in the United States by federal restrictions. The studies provide proof of principle‚Äù that CBD and possibly CBD-THC combinations are valid candidates for novel AD therapies. Less potent than cannabis (from which it's derived), but more potent than hemp (also derived from weed), the specific benefits of CBD are much less well-known than the ingredients itself.</p>
<p>Our full spectrum CBD oil is CO 2-extracted hemp oil which retains native hemp terpenes (fragrance oils), CBD, minor cannabinoids and less than 0.3% THC. That's why it's important to look for products that are third-party tested, meaning a lab has verified that they contain what the packaging says they do. You should be able to find this information on a company's website.
