<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. Our ultimate goal is to create CBD wellness products that we would not only take ourselves but also be proud to share with our friends and family.

CV Sciences products are sold in more than 1,500 health food stores nationally, including Campbell's Nutrition in Des Moines and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in West Des Moines.

But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>

<p>We'll discuss this more in chapter 4, but this just means that CBD oil may have different effects depending on the serving. 7 advantages of the CBD Oil Our CBD is sourced from the highest quality processing labs and you can find our certificates of analysis for each product on our website in the lab reports section. Many CBD products only contain trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), so they won't make you feel high.

<p>Technically speaking, the law now recognizes hemp (and by association CBD oil) as a non-controlled substance and differentiates it from marijuana. One of the most crucial steps in producing CBD oil is isolating the relevant cannabinoids and terpenes via CO₂ extraction. This being the case, there are a lot of companies taking advantage of the CBD oil demand thus are making products that don't contain enough or any CBD at all. Meanwhile, hemp seed oil (sometimes called just hemp oil) is made from only the seeds of the hemp plant and contains minuscule (if any) quantities of CBD.</p>
