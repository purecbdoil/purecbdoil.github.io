<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. This creates a positive effect on the body's pain and inflammation responses. One study split 177 patients with cancer-related pain into three groups: placebo, THC treatment, and THC + CBD treatment. Because it produces no euphoria or psychoactive effects at all, CBD oil is not addictive. All CBD products sold at Indiana locations of Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, a Midwest regional chain, now carry those codes, says Jonathan Lawrence, director of vitamins and body care at the chain. Another recent study , which examined the effect of CBD on an animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), found that the treatment led to an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which, in turn, helped suppress the EAE.</p>

While recreational cannabis use remains illegal in the U.K., CBD products with low THC content (below 0.2%) have been deemed safe for legal consumption (as it is non-psychoactive). While not definitive, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the self-medication theory of cannabis use in ADHD and the need for further studies of the endocannabinoid system in ADHD.</p>
