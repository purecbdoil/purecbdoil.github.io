<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Because CBD is non-psychoactive, you cannot get high from CBD products. Royal CBD oil is a premium full-spectrum extract with powerfully analgesic terpenes, cannabinoids, and plant sterols. The healthy fats found in these mixes allow the body to better process the cannabidiol, optimizing CBD benefits.

<p>This raw extract can be put through a series of filtration and distillation processes to remove unwanted compounds, such as waxes and chlorophyll, and produce various classes of oils differing in purity and CBD content. Fab CBD offers a limited range of products, but what it lacks in variety it definitely makes up in quality. In one study on morphine-addicted rats, CBD oil allowed them to reduce their dependence on the drug. CBD oil isn't likely to cause the same set of negative effects.
