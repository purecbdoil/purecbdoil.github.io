<p>Whether or not you agree with the legalization of marijuana, you can't argue with the proven health benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Despite the above listed potential side effects, a review of clinical data found that the side effects of CBD used for certain applications were less severe than side effects from common medications used to treat those same health conditions.

<p>A broad-spectrum product will contain all of those cannabinoids except the THC - which has been removed. However, it's important to note that operating a vehicle or heavy machinery after taking CBD oil — especially higher doses — can increase one's risk of being involved in an accident. CBD oil can technically be CBD hemp oil, but hemp oil is not necessarily CBD oil — and is most often hempseed oil,” she explains.
