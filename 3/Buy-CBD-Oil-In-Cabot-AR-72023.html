<p>CBD products are becoming more and more popular. CBD and THC are both cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant.

<p>Although raw and refined pure hemp extract is available, the vast majority of CBD oil products contain additional ingredients such as vegetable oils or other essential oils. This step makes the medicinal oils in the plant more bioavailable. Properly produced CBD oil from hemp does not contain THC in high enough concentrations to cause a high. Consumers can expect to be confused by terms like CBD,” hemp,” and marijuana.” All these terms have multiple meanings and can be used in popular but incorrect ways, which only adds to the confusion.</p>

<p>We'll discuss this more in chapter 4, but this just means that CBD oil may have different effects depending on the serving. 7 advantages of the CBD Oil Our CBD is sourced from the highest quality processing labs and you can find our certificates of analysis for each product on our website in the lab reports section. Many CBD products only contain trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), so they won't make you feel high. In a 2010 study on cancer-related pain, study subjects received oral sprays of a combination THC-CBD extract.</p>
<p>If you really can't tolerate CBD oil even with flavors, try looking for CBD vape oils or edibles. Once extracted from hemp or cannabis, CBD can be added to several products, including tinctures, lotions, and oils. As mentioned earlier, CBD products are available in both hemp-based and marijuana-based formulas. The Endocannabinoid System (ECS) is a series of receptors found throughout the body - brain, immune system, central nervous system and more - that respond to cannabinoids the body produces, as well as cannabinoids from plant sources (such as hemp).</p>
<p>But be forewarned about CBD product companies that claim they get their CBD from hemp seeds.

With the increased discussion surrounding the marijuana plant, hemp oil has become relevant again.</p>
