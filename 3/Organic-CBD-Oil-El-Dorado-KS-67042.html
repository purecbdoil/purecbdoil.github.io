The seeds and oil should be free of plant matter that may add additional compounds, such as THC. And, at the very least, the laboratory test results should state the exact amounts of the cannabinoids, so THC and CBD, in the product.</p>
<p>Always check to make sure you know the CBD content of the products you purchase. CBD is not inexpensive like products such as vitamins and minerals. It is because hemp only recently became legal to grow in the U.S. that many of the finished hemp goods that you see for sale in America, from food products to clothing to building materials, are part of an imported hemp industry that has surpassed $688 million annually.
