<p>While the cannabis plant has been used for millennia for its healing and medicinal qualities, broad spectrum CBD oil has only recently begun to get the recognition it deserves. Both hemp and marijuana come from the same plant (Cannabis sativa), which creates a fair amount of confusion. Not all products, however, include that information. While CBD is often used to increase appetites, decrease nausea and decrease pain experienced by cancer patients, the true benefits of the compound may be further reaching.

<p>While both oils come from cannabis plants and both oils are non-intoxicating, hemp seed oil contains very little CBD, so you won't really receive the benefits associated with the entourage effect. The benefits of CBD oil have yet to be proven by concrete scientific research, but the existing studies show promise. The chemical that is responsible for weed's psychoactive effects is called THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol , and it is mostly removed from CBD products. And we're continuing to hear more about cannabis-sourced products.</p>
<p>It's great for beauty products and benefits the skin, hair, and nails, but doesn't treat any conditions or illnesses. If you're in one of the more restrictive states, CBD products can be sent straight to your door if you can't find them locally. There are more expensive CBD oils that guarantee zero THC content available though, so look out for those if you are concerned.

<p>As you shop for CBD products, it's also important to understand that CBD oil is not the same as hemp seed oil (which is sometimes labeled hemp oil).

THC of course is an active component in marijuana that can help with various medical conditions. Cannabidiol may also limit inflammation in the brain and nervous system, which may benefit people experiencing pain, insomnia , and certain immune-system responses.</p>
<p>CBD is generally well tolerated, but people with compromised immune systems or those taking prescription medications could be at risk of side effects. CBD and THC are found in the highest amounts relative to the other cannabinoids found in the plant. For example, one review of existing literature examined multiple trials and studies and found that CBD can treat chronic pain. Our editor's pick for this category is the Medterra CBD Oil Tincture, which contains CBD in addition to other beneficial, hemp-derived compounds including CBG, CBN, CBC, CBDV, and natural terpenes The oil is extracted from hemp plants that are free of GMOs and pesticides, as well.</p>
