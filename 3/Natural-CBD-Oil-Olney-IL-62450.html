There is a slight running theme here in how CBD oil has shown to help so many mental illnesses - from anxiety and pain to depression and schizophrenia.

Whenever something is wrong with your health, your body naturally produces cannabinoids to bring it into homeostasis.

<p>If a CBD oil has more than 0.3% THC, then it's no longer considered as hemp. When cannabidiol oil is drawn from the Cannabis Sativa plant and bottled for consumption, some brands extract the CBD seed oil and combine it within another type of carrier oil for consumption. This was a major leap for epilepsy treatment, but the negative stigma around CBD and cannabis at the time made it hard for the team to publicize their discovery. Many more studies, especially on large numbers of human participants, are still needed to fully understand the effects of CBD oil and other cannabis-based treatments on RA symptoms.</p>
<p>A 2013 study found that CBD treatment can indeed reduce one's dependence on nicotine or tobacco smoking.

<p>There is also some data that points towards the existence of CBD oil benefits for Alzheimer's.

Find out why chronic pain patients are turning to CBD oil as a natural, side-effect free alternative to prescription painkillers. Summary CBD, especially in combination with THC, may be effective in reducing pain associated with diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.
