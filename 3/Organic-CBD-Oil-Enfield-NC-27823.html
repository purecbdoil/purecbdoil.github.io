<p>The natural, holistic remedy has real medicinal use spanning from stopping seizures to alleviating anxiety and helping insomniacs get some much-needed rest-with little to no side effects, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The moral: Large-scale hemp farming is probably not accessible for people with no existing planting experience. The second most common question people have when it comes to CBD oil for pain management or its anti-inflammatory properties is whether or not it is safe to use for arthritis symptoms.</p>
<p>To that end, he is advocating a consumers opt for a specific CBD oil product. However, based on recent studies and 2018's The Essentials of Pain Medicine, Fourth Ed., here are the basics (5).
