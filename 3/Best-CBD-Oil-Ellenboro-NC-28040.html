<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. In short, to determine whether a CBD oil or any other CBD product is legal or illegal depends on a multitude of factors. In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
<p>However, the CBD drug Epidiolex was approved by the FDA in June 2018 to treat intractable epilepsy in pediatric patients - the very first CBD-based drug (and only the second cannabis-based drug behind Sativex) to receive federal approval. Beyond those states, there are 15 states that restrict access to CBD products derived from industrial hemp with less than 0.3 THC. Professor Mechoulam of Israel's Weizman Institute of Science, was instrumental in getting a medical marijuana farm to develop a high cannabidiol and low-to-no THC strain of cannabis.</p>
<h2>Hemp Oil: A Super Food in Ellenboro?</h2>

<p>The receptors, which are categorized as CB1 and CB2, are activated by natural endocannabinoids produced by the human body as well as by plant cannabinoids. In recent studies shown in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, there is an undeniable connection between the reduction of pain and inflammation and CBD. Although there are several products available in the market that can reduce the aging effects, most of them are not effective like CBD oil products.

Hawaii's first wellness-driven hemp company, Mana Artisan Botanics ' CBD oil comes from conscientious farmers, and each product is handcrafted in small batches on the Big Island.</p>
<p>As cannabis and hemp become more extensively researched and widely available, we are starting to realize the true therapeutic power of these plants and their derivatives. As a reminder, CBD products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. In states where medical marijuana or recreational marijuana is legal, marijuana-derived CBD may also be available. The purification process further removes any THC present, but as CBD is derived from cannabis, there will always be minute traces of THC remaining.</p>
