Medical marijuana is somewhat similar to CBD oil in that is contains cannabinoids, though it is harvested differently and contains THC. Cannabidiol — more commonly referred to as CBD oil” — is one of more than 100 different chemical compounds found in the the cannabis plant.

Scientists who sought to study the various therapeutic effects of marijuana first encountered the endocannabinoid system in the 1990s, and the discovery was a significant breakthrough for medical science. But since the SUNY ophthalmologists did not analyze the CBD oil—and offered up theoretical adulterants as a cause, apparently without knowing whether they were in the CBD product or not—they have no idea, really, what this patient consumed, and it seems sort of intellectually reckless to pin the death on CBD,” Grinspoon said.</p>
