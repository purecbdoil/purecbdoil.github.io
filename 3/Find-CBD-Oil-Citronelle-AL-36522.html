<p>The best CBD oils on the market are those that will help you manage your health, change the way that you address your health problems, and will make you feel like a functional human being during the day. Try THC-containing products at home or at night first, so you can sleep off any unwanted effects. Because CBD oil comes from the cannabis plant (organic hemp), it's associated with marijuana.

<p>Cannabidiol and THC are just two of the plant's more than 100 cannabinoids.
