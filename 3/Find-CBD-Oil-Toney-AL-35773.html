<h2>What Really Is CBD and How Does It Work in Toney?</h2>
<p>This oil, extracted from a hemp plant, has been subjected to many legal and moral questions. Note: CBD is not FDA approved for any medical treatments aside from one very specific form of epilepsy.

<p>Crystalline isolate exclusively contains CBD, as other cannabinoids have been removed; full spectrum oil, on the other hand, retains THC and other cannabinoids, and is only sold in states where marijuana use has been legalized.

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>

<p>CBD may help your body convert the most dangerous fat cells into healthier fat cells. Due to the entourage effect, it's believed that full-spectrum CBD is more effective than isolate CBD products for pain. Many products use CBD isolate, which is pure CBD.
