CBD oil is the second most prevalent active ingredient of cannabis, or marijuana.</p>
<h3>Where Can I Buy CBD Oil in Browns Mills NJ?</h3>
<p>While both oils come from cannabis plants and both oils are non-intoxicating, hemp seed oil contains very little CBD, so you won't really receive the benefits associated with the entourage effect. The benefits of CBD oil have yet to be proven by concrete scientific research, but the existing studies show promise. The chemical that is responsible for weed's psychoactive effects is called THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol , and it is mostly removed from CBD products. And we're continuing to hear more about cannabis-sourced products.</p>
