<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. While CBD oil is made from the leaves or buds of a cannabis plant, hempseed oil is made by pressing oil from hempseed,‚Äù says Kyle, who likened it to how olive oil is made by pressing whole olives.
