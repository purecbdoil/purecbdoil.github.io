In fact, the benefits of CBD oil have no connection to a typical marijuana high. These effects typically wear off within hours, although people who take prescription medication should check with their doctor to ensure the oil won't counteract the effects of other drugs. Some companies and studies assert that the additional cannabinoids in full spectrum products help to boost CBD's effects.</p>
