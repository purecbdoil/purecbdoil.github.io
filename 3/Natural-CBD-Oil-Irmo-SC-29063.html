If you want to give it a try, but aren't convinced it is a healthy solution for your condition, take a look at what the science has to say about CBD oil.</p>
<p>These stores are not experts in CBD and may not necessarily be selling trustworthy products. Different cannabinoids interact in different ways and therefore have different effects on the body. Administering CBD oil sublingually is a quicker way to activate its effects. It's always a good idea to buy from a reputable dealer in a legal marijuana state where these products are held to testing standards. CBD and THC work differently in your body's endocannabinoid system, producing different effects.

<p>CBD is short for Cannabidiol, which is the compound present in cannabis plants. Certain states still regard and police CBD as contraband rather than a health supplement if it contains THC. And as no clinical trials have been done on consumer grade CBD, any claims made about a product's benefits are not backed by evidence, just the anecdotal opinion of the unverified- and often biased - user. More research needs to be done, but there is some evidence CBD can protect the heart against vascular damage caused by high glucose, inflammation, or type 2 diabetes, according to a 2013 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology The European Journal of Pharmacology also published a study earlier this year that pointed toward CBD aiding heart health.</p>
