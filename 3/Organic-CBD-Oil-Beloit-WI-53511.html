<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. By massaging CBD products onto sore muscles, joints, and damaged skin, you can focus the CBD oil effects on target areas instead of distributing the cannabinoids throughout your body via your bloodstream. Full-spectrum hemp oil that contains CBD may also help with general stress and tension in the muscles. Today, thanks to our team of CBD specialists and qualified professionals, Premium Jane offers a wide range of products from top-shelf CBD oils and delicious edibles, to premium topicals that are the perfect application for targeted areas of the body.</p>
<p>The murkiness of federal CBD law, and the patchwork of state rules, make selling products with the compound perilous, said Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, an industry group.

<p>Dry Mouth: As is the case with many other hemp- and marijuana-based products, CBD oil often leads to a condition known as dry mouth (or cottonmouth).
