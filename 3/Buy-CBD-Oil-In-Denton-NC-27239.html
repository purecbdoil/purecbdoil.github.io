<p>All types of cannabidiol products have experienced a surge in demand in the last few years. CBD oil comes from the bud and flowers of the cannabis plant. A 2017 study found CBD was effective for chronic neuropathy pain. At EvoPure we are working tirelessly towards this goal and as such have been motivated to create some of the purest, most natural and most research-backed CBD products in the world, in the hope of spreading the news to as many people as possible.

<p>This study found CBD has anti-anxiety properties. Though often used interchangeably, hemp oil and CBD oil have crucial differences in how each one affects your body and health. You must be careful to use only CBD oil to treat any anxiety-related conditions, as any traces of THC can increase anxiety and have the reverse of the desired effect. Like most products you take for your health and specific medical conditions, like cancer and diabetes, CBD oil can't treat your medical issues overnight. We hope that you'll take a good look at Joy Organics and consider us as your preferred source for high-quality CBD oil products.</p>

<p>However, CBD products often contain some THC, which is psychoactive. CBD is considered to have a wide range of medical applications and was the subject of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's Weed” documentary series, where he advocated for the legalization of medical marijuana. CBD is a chemical compound known as cannabidiol, and is derived from the cannabis plant. The legal distinction between hemp and marijuana is based on the plant's THC content. They do not contain other cannabinoids as full-spectrum CBD oils do. Others may prefer products that contain zero THC for various reasons, one of which may be fear of even trace amounts of THC registering on drug tests.</p>

THC is known to have the potential to cause anxiety (often referred to as ‘paranoia' in the setting of cannabis).

Every CBD product is lab tested for quality and potency, and there is a QR code on each product to see third-party test results and confirm that the CBD product you select meets regulatory requirements. Keep in mind that nonprescription CBD products are not FDA-approved, and may be inaccurately labeled. Those cannabinoids could include not just CBD and THC but dozens of other related compounds.</p>
<p>To take effect, cannabinoids like CBD attach to certain receptors in the body's endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex biological system responsible for regulating certain specific aspects of bodily functions, like memory, sleep, and mood, as well as metabolic processes like energy balance. However, there is evidence that it can, in fact, reduce symptoms and side effects of cancer treatments. The best CBD oil comes from extracting CBD from the cannabis plant and then diluting it with a carrier oil.</p>
