<meta name="description" content="CBD Oil in Pewaukee Wisconsin - I can honestly - and sadly - say the only difference I noticed was to my bank balance.' Professor Gino Martini, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Chief Scientist and Professor of Pharmaceutical Innovation at King's College London, says it is important to remember that correctly formulated high-street CBD is of a very low strength; so low that it is classed a food supplement rather than a medicine, meaning it is unlikely that the pharmaceutical industry will ever do clinical trials on it. ‘To be medically effective, the cannabidiol shown in clinical trials - for example, to help children with rare forms of epilepsy - is given at much higher concentrations than what's available for the public to buy,' he says.">

But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>
