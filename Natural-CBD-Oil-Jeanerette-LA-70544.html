<p>Our Ultra Concentrated Hemp Oil is derived from industrial hemp, a type of cannabis plant. CBD is non-intoxicating, it comes with a plethora of potential therapeutic benefits, and above all, it has no side effects of traditional painkillers. Seniors are increasingly looking towards CBD for treating aches and pains, but it can be challenging to find safe products while the market isn't regulated. So our hemp oil products won't get you high. Each batch is tested in a third-party lab, and results can be found directly on the website, which is critical in ensuring the quality of your products. We use a broad-spectrum extract for all of our CBD oils.</p>
<p>By augmenting the body's own cannabinoids, CBD and the other trace cannabinoids found in hemp oil are able to stimulate the endocannabinoid system to encourage balance and optimal functioning. However, when used in moderate amounts, most people do not experience these side effects, and none of them are known for being fatal or particularly dangerous. Let's say you weigh less than 130 pounds and desire light CBD oil effects; this means that 11 mg or less will probably suffice per dose, giving roughly 40 doses from a 450-mg concentration.</p>

Different cannabis plants — often called hemp or marijuana — contain different levels of chemical compounds.

<p>The natural, holistic remedy has real medicinal use spanning from stopping seizures to alleviating anxiety and helping insomniacs get some much-needed rest-with little to no side effects, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The moral: Large-scale hemp farming is probably not accessible for people with no existing planting experience. The second most common question people have when it comes to CBD oil for pain management or its anti-inflammatory properties is whether or not it is safe to use for arthritis symptoms.</p>
<p>Knowing the source of your CBD oil will help you know its quality. Humans have the endocannabinoid system, or ECS, meaning they naturally respond to the influx of cannabinoids from the cannabis plant. For hemp-derived CBD oil, the product's COA would include information on which cannabinoids, along with compounds like heavy metals, are in the product. It's one of the many active cannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa plant. However, within the past decade, they have become increasingly interested in the therapeutic benefits of the other compounds found in both varieties, especially cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
<p>This research suggests that CBD could provide a new treatment for pain. Since it has a minimal amount of the psychotropic compound THC, use of this oil does not result in a traditional high”, so its effects are generally considered therapeutic, not mind-altering. One of the most common reasons that people give CBD to their pets is for stress and anxiety. In fact, it's estimated that pain relief is the most common global cause of use of both CBD and medical cannabis. To understand CBD's potential for benefiting your overall health, it's important to know how it works within your body.</p>
<p>Szaflarski JP, Bebin EM, Cutter G, DeWolfe J, et al. Cannabidiol improves frequency and severity of seizures and reduces adverse events in an open-label add-on prospective study. There are many benefits of CBD oil and there are so many different ways to use it. If you see CO2 extraction on the label of CBD oil, it means that there is a pure product. At the core of these seemingly miraculous effects, is CBD's proven ability to lower inflammation throughout the body. People infuse CBD into tinctures, oils, edibles, and other products without the high-inducing THC.</p>
