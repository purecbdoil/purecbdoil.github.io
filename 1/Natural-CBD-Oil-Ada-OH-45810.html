<p>CBD is extracted from cannabis flowers or cannabis leaves and processed into edible oil. Some consumers prefer CBD products that contain at least small amounts of THC. Healthy Hemp Oil works with a variety of trusted vendors in the hemp and CBD oil industry. While none of this pollen should make it into your CBD oil, and very few people are allergic to marijuana pollen, you should still be careful the very first time using CBD oil and use as tiny an amount as possible. As research into cannabis- and hemp-derived CBD expands, doctors and healthcare providers will have a better understanding of how CBD works and who might benefit most from it.</p>
