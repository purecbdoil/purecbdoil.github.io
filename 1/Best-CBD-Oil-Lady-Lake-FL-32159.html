Keep in mind that finding a legit thc-free CBD oil is tricky with so many misleading brands on the market today.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies suggest that CBD oil can be one of the most effective choices for arthritis and other forms of localized pain caused by inflammation.

You're not really sure what you're getting,” he says, adding that a recent study showed only about 30 percent of commercial CBD products are accurately labeled. In a study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology , 16 cancer patients going through chemo used an oral spray ladened with CBD-rich cannabis an average of 4.8 times per day.</p>
<p>On top of the added medical benefits of THC, CBD oil derived from marijuana, not hemp, has been shown to be of better quality and likely have a slower rate of increased tolerance. Relevant research has shown that CBD oil side effects do exist, even though they are rare. CBD-based products can be taken orally, applied to the skin or inhaled. Additionally, animal studies have been conducted to find that CBD may be a potential treatment for arthritis , and one report concluded that "there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults."
