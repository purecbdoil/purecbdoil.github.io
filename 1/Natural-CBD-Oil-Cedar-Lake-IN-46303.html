<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. In short, to determine whether a CBD oil or any other CBD product is legal or illegal depends on a multitude of factors. In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Preclinical studies suggest that CBD oil can be one of the most effective choices for arthritis and other forms of localized pain caused by inflammation. To test the e-commerce giant's ability to police its marketplace, The Washington Post bought 13 products to see if they included CBD. Whenever something is wrong with your health, your body naturally produces cannabinoids to bring it into homeostasis. But hemp oil‚Äù more often, and more properly, refers to oil made from the seeds of the plant, and contains only very small amounts of CBD, says Lanier at the Hemp Industries Association.</p>

CO2 extraction doesn't require additional solvents, which helps to keep the CBD oils clean and pure. Our Virgin cannabis sativa hemp oil is a hemp seed oil, and our Premium hemp oil products, have hemp oil from the stem of the plant (which is listed in milligrams on the bottle) It also has hemp seed oil in the bottle to act as a carrier oil.</p>
