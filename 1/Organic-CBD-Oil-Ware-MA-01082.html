<p>CBD oil works on the endocannabinoid system in the body, which is responsible for bringing about balance (homeostasis) internally. The resulting product has a higher concentration of CBD than the raw extract, hence the term CBD-rich oil. They source their organic hemp from Colorado and they submit their products to third-party labs to test their purity and safety. Furthermore, while THC binds with CB1 receptors of your body to produce a sense of euphoria, CBD interferes with the binding of THC, reducing its psychoactive effects. For recovery from difficult workouts, the anti-inflammatory effects of CBD oil may be helpful in healing the damage.</p>
<p>In this manner of usage, the oil is measured out according to the best dosage for the individual in question and taken just as any other liquid medication would be.

Since the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, followed by the cannabis revolution in the U.S. over the last decade, CBD and other phytocannabinoids have gained much of the spotlight in the world of contemporary medicine.
