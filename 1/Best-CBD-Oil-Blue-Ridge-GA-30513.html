<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. Our ultimate goal is to create CBD wellness products that we would not only take ourselves but also be proud to share with our friends and family. But there are still products labeled as dietary supplements on the market that contain cannabidiol. CV Sciences products are sold in more than 1,500 health food stores nationally, including Campbell's Nutrition in Des Moines and Fresh Thyme Farmers Market in West Des Moines.

One of the most celebrated health benefits of CBD oil is its analgesic (pain relieving) effects. Of course, price will always be a determining factor in the CBD products you choose to use.</p>

Look for products made from organic, U.S.-grown cannabis. CBD oil is extracted from the Cannabis sativa plant and then mixed with a carrier oil so that your body can more easily absorb it.

<p>Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common side effect for people who take relatively large doses of CBD oil, and is linked to the substance interacting with the digestive system.

Some oils contain other Cannabinoids within the oil. Cannabinoids: Biologically active chemical compounds found in cannabis plants. Cannabinoids are a class of diverse chemical compounds that are found in the cannabis plant.</p>
<p>That means CBD oil can be combined with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana. You need a good amount of dried buds of a high-CBD strain of cannabis that has only trace amounts of THC if any. Early research found that applying cannabidiol gel might reduce anxiety and improve behavior in patients with fragile X syndrome. It's a naturally occurring substance that's used in products like oils and edibles to impart a feeling of relaxation and calm. The research on hemp oil is still relatively new, particularly in the United States and other places where restrictive laws have prevented researchers from fully exploring the potential of cannabis plants until recently.</p>
