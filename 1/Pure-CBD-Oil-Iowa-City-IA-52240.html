<p>Ontario's only online retailer and wholesaler of legal recreational cannabis. CBD is sought for its range of health benefits , which include relief from pain, inflammation and insomnia. American Shaman's CBD oils are made from natural and organic industrial hemp that contains no GMOs, heavy metals, or insecticides and are 100% gluten-free. However, the legality of hemp growth has changed in the past year. But recent studies suggest that full-spectrum CBD oil works better because of a process called entourage effect wherein all the components work together to magnify the therapeutic benefits of each.</p>
<p>Although there is not much hereditary difference between cannabis and hemp, the plants' flowers and leaves contain different amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid responsible for getting high.” Though research has shown some traces of THC in certain CBD oils, most do not contain any THC. But though they argued over the value of the case study and what (if anything) it means, one common theme emerged: it's still the Wild West days for CBD, a drug that is still poorly studied, poorly understood and—with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states, at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas—almost entirely unregulated.</p>

While many remain skeptical about the abilities of CBD oil (and often fail to separate it from the behavior-altering high that results from THC), it is no doubt at the forefront of discussion all over the world.</p>

<p>Trials have found CBD products on sale that contain unlisted and potentially hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.
