However, it's important to note that operating a vehicle or heavy machinery after taking CBD oil — especially higher doses — can increase one's risk of being involved in an accident. CBD oil can technically be CBD hemp oil, but hemp oil is not necessarily CBD oil — and is most often hempseed oil,” she explains. There are thousands of unique CBD extracts online — each with different formulas, total amounts of CBD, hemp sources, delivery methods, bottle sizes, flavors, scents… the list continues.</p>
<p>Hemp oil or hemp seed oil = hemp or cannabis seeds.
