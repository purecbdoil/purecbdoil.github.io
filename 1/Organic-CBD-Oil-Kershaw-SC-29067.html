<p>Some of you may have noticed that CBD oil is being sold in malls and vape shops across Pennsylvania, but be advised that many of these products, since they are made from hemp seeds rather than actual plant material, are negligible in terms of their CBD content â€” and thus negligible in terms of their therapeutic value.
