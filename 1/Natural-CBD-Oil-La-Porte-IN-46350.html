<p>The best CBD oils on the market are those that will help you manage your health, change the way that you address your health problems, and will make you feel like a functional human being during the day. However, that presupposes that the CBD being taken is actually a CBD product with little to no THC in it and not the CBD that is in a THC-dominant strain of cannabis, for example. CBD oil is one of the few effective options available for handling eczema since it contains anti-inflammatory properties with little to no side effects. Pure hemp oil is extracted from the cannabis varieties that are naturally abundant in CBD, and low in THC, which means that taking hemp oil will NOT get you high. Full-spectrum CBD oils allow the user to enjoy the synergistic effects of CBD and THC combined without the psychoactive effects.</p>
<p>In a study into the effects of CBD in people with Parkinson's disease and psychosis, six participants showed significant improvement in symptoms with a dosage of 150 mg per day of CBD. If the answer is yes, then full spectrum CBD oils may not be a feasible option due to their THC content; although these oils contain trace amounts of THC, this may lead to a failed drug test.

<p>Much of this research is still in the early phases (with a lot of room to learn more), however, CBD may be worth adding to a daily routine for those frustrated with traditional treatment options. In the meantime, much research is underway, and many studies about CBD's effects on the human body have already been published.
