<p>The first time a patient brought CBD products into my office I freaked out. However, the benefits and uses of hemp oil are pretty different from those of CBD oil. It is among many effective cannabinoids discovered in hemp, and is known for supporting mind and body in various methods. Some studies imply CBD may help regulate one's circadian rhythm — that's the internal clock your body uses to stay sleepy at night and wakeful during the day.

Beyond those states, there are 15 states that restrict access to CBD products derived from industrial hemp with less than 0.3 THC.

<p>Now that you know a bit more about HOW to choose a good quality CBD oil for your dog, let's talk a bit more about WHY you would give your dog CBD oil. However, studies have concluded that some side effects might be attributed to its interaction with other drugs you might be taking. Studies of CBD oil aren't common. The term "cannabis oil" is sometimes used to describe CBD oil; however, it's more commonly used to describe oil produced from marijuana strains containing significant THC levels. But CBD in its isolate and low-THC forms is not likely to cause anxiety.</p>

Unlike hemp-derived CBD products, those made from marijuana must undergo testing—at least in states that permit medical and recreational use of marijuana. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that around 40% of CBD products purchased online do not contain as much of the compound as printed on the labels.</p>
<p>With CBD oil hot in demand, companies have begun to market their own products looking for a share of shoppers. CBD may help you feel relaxed or less anxious, but you won't get high if you choose to use a CBD-infused oil, tincture, edible, or other product.
