<p>Hemp-derived CBD is legal federally. Even though recreational pot is far from legal on a national scale, the use of medical marijuana is currently permitted in 30 of America's 50 states This might be why the majority of our respondents had already heard whispers about marijuana's non-psychoactive derivative, CBD-a substance oft-used as an alternative treatment for common ailments including pain, depression, and anxiety.

<p>Research done within the Hadassah University Hospital has shown the existence of CBD oil benefits for diabetes. As we mentioned earlier, some CBD oil products are actually oil infused with pure CBD. Many hemp oil extracts are also known to lack the full spectrum of terpenes and other cannabinoids that act synergistically with the CBD. Such products lack the synergistic array of beneficial components found in full-spectrum CBD-rich oil. That being said, it's worth mentioning right out of the gate that the terms hemp oil and CBD oil do not refer to the same thing, although the two are often used interchangeably.</p>

You should be able to find this information on a company's website. CBD Oil has been investigated as an anti-anxiety therapy as well as a potential treatment for depression and sleep-related health conditions.</p>
