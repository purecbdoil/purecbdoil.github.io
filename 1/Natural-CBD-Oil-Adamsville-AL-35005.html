<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. In short, to determine whether a CBD oil or any other CBD product is legal or illegal depends on a multitude of factors. In a 2018 study , CBD appeared to have neuroprotective effects on rats with diabetes, including helping preserve their memory and reducing nerve inflammation. If that is not clear enough, there's another 2017 study on rats which revealed that CBD oil may be much safer and more effective at treating osteoarthritis joint pain than other available treatment options. CBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound (one of 120) that belongs to the family of cannabinoids.</p>
<p>The same 0.3 percent THC level restriction is used for CBD oil, too. Very thoughtful on part of the writer to describe the real image of the CBD products. Unlike other cannabinoids — such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — CBD does not produce a euphoric high” or psychoactive effect. Do you know the difference between full-spectrum,” broad-spectrum,” and CBD isolate?” CBD isolate refers to products that contain only CBD, but broad-spectrum products include a range of other cannabinoids (such as CBN, CBC, and CBG), terpenes, and other beneficial substances.</p>

Many cannabis-based products are available to buy online, but their quality and content is not known. CBD also inhibits the re-uptake of neurotransmitters adenosine and anandamide , both known to elevate mood and limit the effects of anxiety.</p>
<p>It's important to know that although THC and CBD are the most studied components of cannabis, there are many more chemical compounds found within the plant, such as the phytocannabinoids cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), as well as terpenes and flavonoids. CBD oil is an isolated extraction of the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol. THC is the psychoactive component of cannabis that causes a euphoric high, but CBD oils contain very low concentrations of THC.</p>
