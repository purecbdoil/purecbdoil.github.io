<p>CBD Oil contains cannabidiol and often other cannabinoid compounds in an oil suspension called a carrier oil. Depending on where you live, it may or may not be possible to purchase medical-grade CBD oil that's derived from marijuana. CBD is extracted using different processes, but CO2 extraction produces by far the purest, safest, and most effective end products.

<p>The additive's hemp oil is blended with two ingredients, propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, which are used in high-quality vape juices so the oil produces robust clouds of vapor.

In a study of patients with arthritis, CBD effectively reduced pain, stiffness and inflammation In another study of those with multiple sclerosis, patients experienced improvement in pain reduction, walking and muscle spasms when taking CBD.</p>
<p>Many of them do not have access to proper healthcare, and medication is expensive, so CBD is a helpful alternative to pharmaceutical drugs (CBD does not cure anything, though, and is not a replacement for pharmaceutical medications — it only makes symptoms more comfortable to live with).

<p>Interestingly, research has shown that CBD acts to reduce the psychoactive effects of THC, separating hemp further from marijuana. To make sure you are getting genuine CBD oil, check the CBD concentration on the container of the product you're purchasing.
