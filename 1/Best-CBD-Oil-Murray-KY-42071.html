<p>One of the most common questions among those just learning about cannabidiol (CBD) and the compound's properties and benefits is whether CBD oil can cause a high. Coffee shops sell CBD lattes, spas offer CBD facials, beauty companies are rushing to release lotions with CBD or hemp oils in their formulas. Much of the CBD used medicinally around the world comes from the hemp plant, and not from psychoactive marijuana. A 2016 study published in The Permanente Journal examined the effectiveness of CBD oil for Pediatric anxiety and insomnia as part of post-traumatic stress disorder. Cannabidiol (more commonly known as CBD) has experienced a surge in popularity in recent months, in part due to its availability in high-street health shops.</p>
<p>Most of the CBD oils currently sold in America come from hemp — giving them the alternative name, hemp oils. De Faria SM, de Morais Fabrício D, Tumas V, et al.

<h2>How much CBD should I take in Murray, Kentucky?</h2>
<p>The plant Cannabis sativa has two primary species, hemp and marijuana. Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, impacts the brain without a high, and tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC, has pain-relieving properties. The plant is cold processed in high quality extra virgin hemp seed oil. Overall, CBD oil is extracted from the flowers of the hemp plant, instead of the leaves or seeds. One study found that a single dose of cannabidiol helped to reduce blood pressure in healthy patients. On the other hand, CBD oil is made with extracts from the flowers, leaves, and stalks of cannabis Sativa, which are rich in CBD and other cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Brands can only sell their products as a food supplement, and must not make medical claims. However, many consumers may be unaware of the actual cannabinoid content of their CBD oil. The updated 2018 Farm Bill will remove hemp from the DEA's list of controlled substances which will also increase the exposure of potential medical CBD benefits.
