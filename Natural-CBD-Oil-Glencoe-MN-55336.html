<p>THC and CBD oil have the same basic molecular structure, with subtle differences in the arrangement of atoms that makes the difference between getting high and not. More research is needed to determine the exact role that terpenes play in the overall effects of CBD oil, but it seems clear that terpenes work in concert with cannabinoids to produce a richer effect than CBD alone. First, testing by the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has found evidence of ‘potential adverse health effects' from CBD (more on that later) and the FSA has concerns over CBD products being sold that contain unlisted and possibly even hazardous ingredients, or illegal levels of psychoactive THC.</p>

Most drug screens are targeting delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and don't detect constituents of other hemp-based cannabidiols. For the highest concentration of CBD, products like our flagship brand Real Scientific Hemp Oil (RSHO) pure CBD hemp oil gives you up to 190 mg of CBD per serving.</p>

Using these uniquely potent plants, it is possible to extract cannabis oil that contains significant levels of cannabidiol, as well as essential vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other non-psychoactive cannabinoids. Taking advantage of the rise in demand, a lot of unscrupulous manufacturers and cannabis growers have come into the industry with the sole intent of making money, without paying much thought to the welfare of the people to whom they sell their products.</p>
