<p>CBD really is the latest new health trend all around the world. Most promisingly, in a recent study, one in 10 users reported that CBD cured their chronic anxiety, making it the ultimate chill pill. As always, discuss with your healthcare provider before starting any new medications or supplements to ensure that there are no interactions with your current medication and treatment regimens. Sometimes companies forget to post it — you can call or send a formal request to check it. If the company refuses to show you the lab report, it is a strong reason not to buy any products from them.</p>
<p>CBD is legal in the UK as long as it's THC content doesn't exceed 0.2%. Because of this, most CBD products in the UK are made from hemp as it is naturally low in THC and high in CBD.

Although these initial results look promising, scientists need to carry out studies in humans to confirm the benefits of this oil. These oils can often be confused with hemp-derived CBD oil, when in fact, the two are quite different from one another.</p>
